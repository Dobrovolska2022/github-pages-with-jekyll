VAIO – a familiar name and brand to some – is expanding its FE series of laptops in North America to include Windows 11 PCs aimed at multitaskers looking for all-in-one devices for work, creation, gaming and entertainment. With 12th Gen Intel core processors, these PCs can meet demanding needs quickly and use up to 46% less energy for up to 10 hours of use before needing to charge.
